Break My Stride
Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China, in a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean? And you said

Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running in a one touch ground, oh no
I got to keep on moving

You're on the road and now you pray you'll last
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're running so fast? And she said

Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running in a one touch ground, oh no
I got to keep on moving

(Never let another girl like you)
Whip me over
(Never let another girl like you)
Drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you)
I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you)
Have to say, oh!

Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running in a one touch ground, oh no
I got to keep on moving
